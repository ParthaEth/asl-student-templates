This dissertation is based on the experimental work done on the topic of scalability improvement of bundle adjustment algorithm. None of the text, or figure in this article has been  taken directly from previously published or collaborative works.

The implementation of Constrained key-frame based Localization and Mapping (CKLAM) technique presented in the first few chapters was primarily done by me with code organization directives and PR reviewing comments from my supervisors, Thomas Schneider, Marcin Dymczyk. The evaluation metric and test cases were designed by me with advises from my supervisors. The extension RCKLAM proposed, its implementation and evaluation are my original work.

The CKLAM algorithm described in chapter \ref{sec:CKLAM} is a work by Esha D. Nerurkar, et al. The entire work presented was don in the Autonomous Systems Lab ETH with additional incidental contributions from many of the groupâ€™s members.
