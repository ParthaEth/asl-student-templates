This dissertation is based on the experimental work done on improving scalability of the Bundle Adjustment (BA) algorithm. None of the text, or figures in this article has been taken directly from previously published or collaborative works, other than the ones that are duly cited.

The implementation of Constrained Key-frame based Localization and Mapping (CKLAM) technique presented in the first few chapters was primarily done by the author with code organization directives and PR reviewing comments from the student's supervisors, Thomas Schneider and Marcin Dymczyk. The evaluation metric and test cases were also designed by the author with advice from the supervisors. The proposed extension RCKLAM, its implementation and evaluation is an original work.

The CKLAM algorithm described in chapter \ref{sec:CKLAM} is a work by Esha D. Nerurkar, et al \cite{CKLAM}. The entire work presented in this thesis was done in the Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Zurich, with additional incidental contributions from many of the groupâ€™s members.
